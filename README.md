# DominionShuffler
A simple, cross-platform app for shuffling randomizer cards in the setup phase of the Dominion deck-building board game.

Note that this makes use of boost (currently at the bleeding edge with v1.59) and the SuddenMagic extensions library, which can be found at: https://github.com/capsocrates/SuddenMagic .
